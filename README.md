Detector used:
CZT Detector 2

Sources used:
* Ba-133
* Cs-137
* Cd-109
* Am-241

Detector was irradiated on the anode side and cathode side by each source. For anode side data, data collection was triggered on the 5th anode. For cathoe side data, data collection was triggered on the cathode. For anode side data, the `12032022_czt_acquisition_perpixel_anode.json` config file was used, and for the cathode side data the `12032022_czt_acquisition_perpixel_cathode.json` config file was used.
